# Introduction to Deep Reinforment Learning

## Machine Learning Method
There are three typical types of machine leanring methods:
1. Supervised Learning: given labeled data, train the model for predicting the correct result

2. Unsupervised Learning: given unlabeled data, train the model to find underlying patterns between data

3. Reinforcement Learning: get feedback (state and reward) from interacting with the environment, and adjust new action to the environment to get maximum expected reward.

Method Comparison | Input Data | Output Result | Types of Problem | Application
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
Supervised Learning | Labeled data | Prediction result | Classification; Regression | Risk Evaluation; Forecasting
Unsupervised Learning | Unlabeled data | Underlying pattern | Clustering | Recommendation; Anomaly detection
Reinforcement Learning | Learn from environment | Action to the enviroment | Exploration and Exploitation | Self driving cars; Gaming

## Reinforcement Learning
As mensioned previously, reinforcement learning get feedback from interacting with the environment without having predefined data. It is a goal-oriented method that an agent tries to come up with the best action given a state.
